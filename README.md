# Neural Network Charity Analysis
Module 19: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

## Overview

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- **Variable as model target.** The IS_SUCCESSFUL variable is the only model target. A value of 1 or 0 indicates that the funding money was uses either successfully or unsuccessfully. 
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- **Variables as model features.**
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?** Use the automated NN finder.
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- **What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?** Use the automated NN finder.

## Summary

- Summarize results
- **Recommend and justify a different model to solve the classification problem.** Choose from logistic regression, random forest, or SVN.
